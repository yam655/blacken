# Introduction #

As soon as graphics became widely available some folks started trying to write Roguelike games as graphical games. Some of these managed to succeed as games, but even the successes failed to live up to the best qualities of Roguelike games.

What are the pros/cons of character-based interfaces?
  * innumerable monsters with non-squinty graphics
  * top-down map views
  * constant-sized maps/creatures
  * large views of maps
  * small development teams
  * highly complex interactions
  * no concern about spiraling graphic complexity

What are the pros/cons of graphical interfaces?
  * x monsters require x graphics
  * attempts to "flavor" tiles result in tiny hard-to-see differences
  * usually result in squinting or poor map visibility
  * they usually look ugly
  * they are more acceptable for the masses
  * differentiation requires a lot more front-end work
  * usually results in reduced gameplay detail and less backend complexity

One of my favorite features of the Roguelike game is the rich gameplay detail. This is really what drove me to the genre. I always wanted to see more of my map. I loved the fact that while you knew the graphics you would see, you never knew what they would **be**. The rich interactions available were awesome.
